# 2D-PLATFORMER-MARIO-LIKE
Mario-like 2D-Platformer
This small pet-project of 4 scenes (main menu, 2 simple levels with enemies, portals, animations, end-game screen) is made to show what I know about Unity, how it works and etc.
Skills gained during this pet project:
  1. Animation (Blend trees, animations)
  2. Tilemaps (palletes, sorting layers, tilemap colliders)
  3. Cinemachine (Set borders of camera. follow the player, find a player when game starts - means there is no need to drag in player-object in Inspector manually. It's made through script)
  4. SceneManagment (Changing levels, transitions)
  5. UI (Main menu, canvas, UI-elements, buttons & etc.)
Many other things will appear here in the near future.
